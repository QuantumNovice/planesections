A lightweight beam bending library built on [OpenSeesPy](https://github.com/zhuminjie/OpenSeesPy).
I noticed there was no package for beam bending in python that worked to my satisfaction.
Being built on OpenSees, the structural results are reliable, and there is lots of room to build more complex models.

Currently a work in progress. To be compeleted before intial release:
- pip package
- read the docs website
- Examples
  - Compare simple cases with analytic equations.
  - Compare complex cases with sap/rfem/etc.

Future work:
 - Timoshenko beams
 - Nonlinear beams analysis
 - simple frame analysis?
