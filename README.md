A lightweight beam bending library built on [OpenSeesPy](https://github.com/zhuminjie/OpenSeesPy).
I noticed there was no package for beam bending in python that worked to my satisfaction.
Being built on OpenSees, the structural results are reliable, and there is lots of room to build more complex models.
While OpenSees can analyze nearly anything, the emphasis is on providing a quick way to analyze beams.

Expect sytax changes before final release, use with caution.

Currently a work in progress. To be compeleted before intial release:
- [] pip package
- [] read the docs website
- [] Examples
  - [] Finish landing page with code examples and figures.
  - [] Compare simple cases with analytic equations.
  - [] Compare complex cases with sap/rfem/etc.

Future work:
 - Timoshenko beams
 - Nonlinear beams analysis
 - One way Slabs?
 - Two way Slabs?
 - Orthtropic Slabs?
 - Basic simple frame analysis?
 - Basic Nonlinear frame analysis?
